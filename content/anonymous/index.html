  <h1>You do not have a project selected.</h1>

  <p>
    Which means you won't really get to see much, including the preview not
    updating when you edit the associated HTML file...
  </p>

  <p>
    So: click that "switch" button to the left, to switch to a "real" project,
    and then if you're feeling adventurous, press the "!!!" button to load all
    the files in your project directory as editor tabs =)
