# Comparing browser editors

This repo is an attempt to explore the various browser-based editor frameworks like [Ace](https://ace.c9.io/), [Monaco](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor), and [Codemirror](https://codemirror.net/).

I have no preference, but that doesn't mean they're all equally useful. These will be ranked based on a [list of criteria](https://github.com/Pomax/browser-editor-tests/issues/7) that no single editor will be able to hit, and that's the point: no one's actually written a real browser-based editor that you just install and off you go, even in 2024 it's a ridiculous "you get the LEGOs and now you get to 3D print your own additional LEGOs" situation.

Feel free to let me know what additional criteria you'd expect a proper browser-based editor to come with. These aren't "what editors offer" criteria, but "what I, as a user, expect" criteria.
